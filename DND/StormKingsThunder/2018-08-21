Story:
we kill them all!
wargs were chewing on a dead dog.
tavern to the north, stables and a farm to the east
we head into the tavern. as we come in, there is an enormous rock in there,
wreckage everywhere.
We hear something from the kitchen, a dead goblin is in the main area
Rob speaks in common, yells out to the kitchen. Rummaging stops, we hear a scraping sound.
We see scrape marks on the floor. whatever left went through a hole in the wall.

Chris sees a treasure goblin, Dan fires a super arrow. Gum gum's sack had a lot of loot in it.

We go upstairs, 2 rooms on each side. left - CD right - EF.
Calls out and nobody answers. Ryan knocks on the door, no answer.
Opens it, sees a bedroom that was above the kitchen.
Ryan thieves tool the locked chest. It opens and we loot chest

Next bedroom seach, bagpipes puts the bearskin cloak on.
Next bedroom is similar.
Final has a large hole in the floor. EVERYTHING IS PRETTY MUCH DESTROYED IN HERE.
We find a woman lying on the ground and a snake with wings is nearby.
She comes to conciousness, pulls Ryan aside and all Zantaran listen in.
She mentions Zarkan (sp?) Known as one of the 7 snakes. She explains she was sent here
to hole up. Cloud giants dropped boulders and i hid/fled. They stole the knights stone.
We need to retake this place from the goblins. We may need to deal with guards in the keep.
She's going to send message when we are ready.

She also killed the goblin downstairs.
