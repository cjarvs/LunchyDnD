Story:
Knightstone is famous for an obelist called the knights stone.
We think it is magic but don't know for sure.

We hear a bell and it sounds like it is coming from the temple.

Nandar Keep, the lord of the keep was killed years ago by elves in the forest.
They took exception at the invasion of their land
Lady bell got peace with the elves, so nobody mixes into the others' land

We cross the drawbridge. The more perceptive of us see large wolf tracks, large and small
humanoud tracks.

We go to the temple. Gnomenclature sees two wargs eating something on the ground across the square.

We go into the temple and see a mostly empty room.
We see a half open door. We go in it.
The bed is ripped up, we see a bunch of stuff on the ground. We see a starcase that leads up to the steeple.

We (pablo and bandebris) take lethandar and melikie's priestly vestments.

Head up the steeple, the bells are ringing. We see 2 goblins hanging from the bells
having a really good time dinging them.

3 blocks of incencse, silver holy symbol of maliki, stolen worthless effects, 3 empty vials, 37 copper

We see the wargs are still eating.

Pablo is interested in the graveyard. We try to sneak and fail, but somehow make our way to the
graveyard without being molested.
We do see an above ground crypt with Nandar on the name. We think this is the grave of the former lords.
Pablo pries open the crypt successfully. He breaks open the coffin and we only see the skeleton.

The boulders are about 500lbs.

Bandebris tries to sneak to the boulder, barely successful.
Salt tries to sneak to the boulder, successfully.

Rob casts acid splash and hits both wargs! 3 and 5 dmg.
