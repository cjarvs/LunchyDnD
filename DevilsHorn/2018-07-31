We look around the beach, looting the bodies
3 have coins that we take, 34 copper 7 silver
Dwigette puts in the party loot.

We see a few paths, choose Due South because of the TV show
We go down the path south and come to an outcropping of rocks
We see a bunch of mutated men (no weapons) dressed in fulamian sailor garb
They look like crazy, bloated Deep Ones
"Alright, time to kill these freaks" - Cro
