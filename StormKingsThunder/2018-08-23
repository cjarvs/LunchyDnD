Story:

We decide to share with the whole party that we are putting a positive spin on
securing the town.

It is hard to hear for remotes...

We all gather a bunch of stuff then move on to explore the rest of the town.

Rob finds a hidey-hole

We found 2 enemies that could not hear or see us.

Rob tosses a firebolt and misses.
Acid splash has pretty badly burned them.
