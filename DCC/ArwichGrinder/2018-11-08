Story:
Ish clangs his helmet and weapons together to make noise and "jr" clangs away

Dan goes up to see if there is any giant creature of grotesqueness.
Looking in corners and crap to do what he can to just search around.
He can kind of see barrells

We cannot see "jr" when we have a light source on him.

Dan is the only one up there, roll'd initiative

Fight
Jr
- starts lurching at Dan
- Loud hiccupy sound he makes, like a baby who spits up
- Nobody sees this, but Dan does not come back down
- Body starts melting

Dan
- throws his fine suits down to the party
- suits make it

Jr
- Dan melts and takes 2 points of damage

We carry Karen Carpenter around

We find 4 more books

Travels among the savages - in good condition

Going down to the south

Taylor opens door - it is a kitchen with rotting veggies and mice
Smoked meat hanging from the ceiling. looks like pig, but nobody knows
dirty cutting board on the counter

Ish collects all the knives

We go through the door on the left and find uncle charles sleeping
Taylor tries to gently shake him awake
He wants a chamber pot, Taylor gives it to him

Ish gets him smoked meat and bread. Uncle charles eats it and talks to us.
He is senile as F. Hands Taylor the chamber pot back, used, and falls back to sleep.

We keep exploring. Taylor gets a carved goat and brings it with him.

3 vagualy curwin looking people come through the door and say
"hay what are you doing here??"
