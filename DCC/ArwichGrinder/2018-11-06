Story:
The group is traveling rooms

Go into an empty room, hear someone screaming from down the hall
We run to the last door on the left

See a "Karen Carpenter" character who is screaming "You can't have my baby!"
 her stomach is a big flap of skin hanging down.
 She says "He'll do you in!"

We ask who she is. She says she is Lorraine.
She attacks Dan for 1. He tries to push her off but she is sticking on him.
She attacks Dave and hits for 1

Ish throws a goose at her, she hits it across the room.

Taylor tries to hit, misses. She retailates for 1 dmg.

Knocks her out with a shovel.

Ish cuts her nails while she is knocked out.

She is tied up and the group keeps looking around. Finds a small room with barrels and it smells terrible.
It is blood and moldy meat.

Dan puts up a big meat slab on a pitchfork
