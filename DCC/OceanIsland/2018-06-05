  a flash in the middle shows a vision
  the portal closes and the entire cavern shakes
  enormous roots
  "vim you fusckstick we are in a tree"
  EVERYONE IS BURIED ALIVE
  the rocks pile around us as and there is no harm
  pushing up through the roots and soil we are right where we started our journey.
  there is nothing where we were but a small sapling
  we discover a tiny creature beneath us, something between a spider an octopus
  we know erstah is no more
