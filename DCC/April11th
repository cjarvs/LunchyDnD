*** we all just sit and wait
*** a shock ripples through
    darkness deeper than night ascends
    we can feel the dark force of its miasmic force beating down on us
    this is erstal! heat light and hope flee from the room!
    the central stone area has this swirling black hole thing in the middle
    we can see clearly there is a tendril going ot the dwarf, his entrails scattered about
    dust and particles, the dead mormerug hearled out of the ring about 15 ft
    a wave of cold filled the room
