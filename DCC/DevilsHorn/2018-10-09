Fight Cont'd:
VIM lost some stamina, but is back alive!

Dwigette uses detect magic and detects herself
We decide to open some of the sleeping pods
We heal up


**** 5 disapprovals for JACK
- JACK MUST UNDERGO A TEST OF HUMILITY, MUST REFER TO THEM AS THEIR
SUPERIOR FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY OR HE LOSES ALL HIS SPELL CASTING SHIT

Robert says toss me a heal man, successful after 2 disapprovals
Robert gets healed to 5
Jack stops healing and starts chanting
A giant elk centuar shows up and says "you did this to him"
We all start weeping uncontrollably at the sound of its voice
We see where he is standing, flowers and lillies have sprouted
 up from where he is standing, then disappears

Dwigette makes an educated guess on what the knob does to open a door
She does the dial a tiny bit up where it is, whiff sneaks out and sees
  2 squidbillies
Whiff reports back

JACK
- Heals VIM

VIM
- "can't get out of the console.... anyone?...anyone?" - Rob
- Sneaks and tries to backstab one, totally a hit, vim like stabs him in the eye socket
  if he didnt die from the blow, he would have been blinded

- "only whiff can be given such a golden chance and fuck it up"
