Story:
Cro and Mo are both all tied up

Robert hit the same button as miriam and the console emitted a blueish mist.
Robert searches the blank wall to the southwest but finds nothing.

Miriam tries hitting buttons on the console and the door goes opaque

Miriam tries hitting buttons on the console and takes 2 dmg from shock

Jack tries hitting buttons, closes up tank 1 and it refills with water
 Turns the doors to tank 1 opaque
 Incredibly loud noise goes on and needs a fortitude save
 over a 10 gets 2pts dmg, under 10 takes 3

We go into the hallway to inspect the unopened doors

Intelligence check for those who have been messing with the console.
Jack feels like he knows about a group of controls for opening and darkening the tanks.

Jack knows how to darken the tanks, then opens up tank #2.
Water drains into the room, water is up to our waist.
The water comes out and there is a really terrible smell

There is a dead creature in there.

Jack recognizes it as looking sort of like a cthulu monster

He then tries to open the third door. Does so successfully.

We see 5 deep one hybrids, 1 distinctly feminine with nice clothes.

The other 4 attack us.

Eammon is out in the hall still, pissed off his books got water logged
