Story:
From last time:
A strange wind wafts over us. Fortitude saves:
    Whiff: get bug eyes +2 points of strength, -5 Search checks
    Dwigt: get bug eyes +1 agility -1 luck, -5 Search checks
    Cro: now he has claws. id3+1 dmg. any time you might hurt him. +1 strength -1 luck
    Miriam: mutated, bug eyes, -1 personality -1 luck, -5 Search checks

Cro totally flubs feather fall, then realizes he shouldn't use it again!
We light our torches and find out it is frictionless, then pretty much slide down in a hurry!

The long cavernous chamber looks slick and wet, it is just the reflection of the light.
We see several figures in the chamber, they look hideously mutated. More like us than the
mutant guys we saw earlier.

Mo fails fort save, now he has webbed fingers, toes,and claws
Fumble score goes up,
    1d3+1 dmg for his claws,
    -1 pt of luck -1 pt of personality

Robert gets claws and gills.
    1d3+1 dmg for claws,
    gills make it harder to sneak dc +5 to stealth
    can breathe under water
    +1 str
    -1 luck

Dwigt: gets claws and gills.
    1d3+1 dmg for claws,
    gills make it harder to sneak dc +5 to stealth
    -1 pt personality
    -1 luck

It feels like there is some sort of pressure on us as we fail our for saves

Whiff sneaks around a bit and checks out what's ahead!
He sees about 8 deep one hybrids huddled together looking into the next room.
Whiff crawls back and reports to everyone there are 8.

SUPER EASY TO SURPRISE THEM
