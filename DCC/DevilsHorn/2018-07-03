Story:
We try to calm them down and talk to the two survivors and they join us
We were using the sextant to navigate but crashed on the north side of the reef at night.
The ship made large booming and cracking sound as it broke apart

One is not mutated, he says he was thrown away from the boat and used the reefs to rest.
The other went to the island and saw some unusually large crustaceans. Jumped in the water
  then swam and we found them.

Whiff detects a reef trap, then does NOT find a way through

Burns 2pts of luck and Whiff finds a path through.

We take the longboat up to the island coast.
We see on the northeast corner a black shape in the far eastern corner of the Devil's Horn.
There is a beach to land on in the south.
We pull the boat up to the wide, tan beach.
As we talk about where to go next, 3 giant crimson azure crabs.
