Story:
Whiff - kept webbed fingers and claws
Miriam not has the chills, she is constantly shaking and chattering his teeth
Whiff - torso keeps on melting like wax

We want to open up the chest on the ship,
Vim tries and triggers a trap - poison needle jams into his finger
  fort save, not very high, 3 permanent stamina points permanently
  sweating profusely

Box of:
  1,000 gold ingots
  bolt of crimson silk with gold trim
  fancy gold scimitar with a clawed hand

We leave it alone.

The boat gets to the shore, the princess had some time to think,
the bergermeister is pleased to see us.

Princess gives us the sword, we also get 300 gold for our efforts.

Robert takes the sword (in party loot)
We are all rested now
