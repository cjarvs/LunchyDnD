+4 exp
Cro levels up.

Out of combat, Jack heals Rachel.

The sound of dripping water emanates throughout the passage.
There is a pool of black liquid. The drip is coming from above the pool.
"Wow what a beautiful pool"

Before we rest, Rachel throws a rock into the water.
"bloop"

Now we rest. Everyone gets a point of health back.

Will check, everyone under 10 gets no rest benefits. There is a wash of pain over us, and it disturbes us greatly;
as if a star has died.

Whiff, Robert, Cro, GreenMan were on watch.
That night, Whiff is sitting there doing his thing, a spider the size of a dinner plate bites him. Fort save of 6, whiff is at -1 to strength and agility as he feels ill from the poison.
Hits it for 5 and almost kills it.
It runs and releases a puff of hair in a 5 ft radius. It is super irritating as it lands on Whiff's skin.
Rolls a 1. It fucks up his stamina for 1 point.
