Story:
- we decide to all climb up
- we will free climb to the top to attach the grappling hook
- Aspen FALLS TO HER DEATH SPLAT!!!! She is a paste.
- Corey Feldman attaches the grappling hook to the top
- Phil's make it up
- Tomsic's make it up
- Chris' make it up
- we are going to cross the rings!
- 2 of Tomsic's made it on the rings!
- Too Tall Hall rolled a 1, lost his grip as he was climbing
  he was just Too Damn Tall - 49pts of damage, breaking multiple bones
- Chris' make it up!
- there is a path from the platform to the structure that ends at a
  transparent tube with an opening the size of a door
- we see on the side of the dome a transparent substance where we can only
  make out shapes and pastel. (one might call them windahs)
- Fallon Mignolet and Handles go to inspect the tube opening
  Out of nowhere (probably behind you kind of, or in front of you)
  a voice says autokerr activated, a run with your pet through the park
- Both of us turn to the right and start running so we dont get flung off
  the platform!
- Fallon burns a point of luck to try figuring out the artifact (not 9/10)
  Touches the closest button she can find and is BLOWN UP, then
  FLUNG OFF. She died.
- Handles leaps over the blown up body of Fallon and decides he
  does not want to try hitting a button and jumps to the tube.
  He misses the jump, bounces off the stationary part of the track,
  then is bounced off and flung off the side of the track and falls
  to his doooooooooommmmmmm......
- Tomsic tries to attack the treadmill!
