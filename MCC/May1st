- Ok, not really we run again.
- we see we are about an hour walk from the tower we are going toward
- the base of the tower is strangely overgrown, choked with tall weeds
  the dome shaped building and stalk are wrapped with a blanket of vines,
  small insects are in there
  we slam into an invisible wall of hard air!
  We surmise the robot cannot ge to mow the weeds because of this barrier
- We run around the perimiter of this stalk, trying to avoid the robot
  2 of us find a drainage duct behind a group of small bushes,
  we see a grate, and a force screen separate from the air with a slot,
  we use the card and escape the robot,
  after a while he goes back to trimming and weeding
- We crawl through a vent duct and find ourselves in the perimiter of the hard air shaft
- Elmer wants to burn the vines, but is convinced otherwise
- 6 of us climb instead.
- 2 of us make it all the way up, 4 are hanging out halway up
- we find that some metal hoops leading to the northern edge of the dome are there.
  they are placed 2-3 ft from each other, leading from the shaft to the outside edge of the mushroom
  We shimmy through the tube to the top
  We make our way out to the diameter of the mushroom tower,
  we see a platform with a slightly ribbed surface with a metal projection on the outside most facing side.
  a path from the platform leads to the structure but ends in a transparent tube with an open face
- We at the top shout down to get everyone up
