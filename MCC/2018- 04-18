Story:
- We found a gash in the ground where something fell from the storm!
- A tunnel showed up underneath
- in a giant room there are rails and two tunnel openings
- we see fellow tribe members gouped around metal rock, holy symbols are everywhere, one exit caved in with rocks
- as we get to the room, a big bubble shaped thing flies from one of the entrances and stops in front of us all
- we want to get into the bubble because there are seats inside
- there is an amber panel on the outside with a slot
- Taylor got a metal sign shield
- Jason got a turnstyle club
- Chris found a cube
- Doug found a box
- Doug tries to open the box,
  figures out he can spin some dials (like raised cogs) on top,
  there are symbols of the ancients and you can turn those,
  and there is a button next to those (doesn't do anything when pushed),
  and one other button (which Doug pushed, makes the box levitate in the air around hand height),
  Doug unlevitates it and holds it
- Dave found a small leatherite bag with a plastic film car that folds out with pictures of the area we are in,
  looks to be a map,
  little plastille card inside,
  there is a picture of the bubble on the plastic film
- Phil found a corpse among the rocks with a suit the ancients might have worn,
  a badge hangs from the suit,
  and a long skinny thing in a holster,
  it is in an "L" shape, some device of the ancients
- We try to get onto the bubble using the keycards
- the rectangular seam opens, we know you have a choice when PAX sub shuttle systems
- 7 point restraint tries to get us down, we must make fort saves for those paired up in a seat,
  everyone successfully gets out of their chairs,
  bubble goes 660mph in a sonic boom,
  everyone standing is slammed into the rear wall of the shuttle,
  we all survive, barely, pinned to the wall
- everyone sitting gets a nice warm drink. after 20 minutes we come to a smooth stop
- we are released from the chair straps and the doors open again, thanks for choosing PAX systems...***crackle**crackle** (it trails off)
- we all get off and are now in a smaller, naturally lit station
- the light comes from a barred doorway at the other side of the room, which we approach
- there is a slot next to the portal,
  we insert the badge into the slot,
  some energy shield drops too
- we go outside of the den of the tube thing,
  see a nearly unimaginable landscape,
  a well-ordered garden appears,
  we see walkways, mowed lawn, rows of flowers, fruit trees (with unfamiliar fruit),
  and in the distance a tower of the ancient ones draped in a tangled vine and verdant ivy,
  we see the large and complex bulk of a godplace balanced on a slender stalk of metal (looks kind of like a giant mushroom),
  as if it is a replica of the petaled flowers at our feet
- Elon Musk is picking flowers,
  we all look around,
  about 30 seconds in we decide to go to the tower,
  a huge 15 ft trunk waves its arms in our direction with a spinning blade mechanism coming at us!
