Story:
- we continue the fight! Doug joins today!
- Eva takes a spear d5+1
- We take the mcguffin, Tomsic gets the thing
  note: now Wayne/Garth have the turnstyle/thing
- Tomsic tries to figure out what it is, snaps off a vital part
  of the artifact. tries to put it back, does not know how to put it
  back together. EVERYONE FAILS. Finally Corey Feldman puts it back together
  and figures it out!
- we see a battery cell inside, Corey pushes the button and flame jets out
  nobody gets hurt, finds out it is a fusion torch

- We are looking around the room now:
  there are various chairs and lounges, insects were eating off metallic foil plates,
  there are 4 doors, 2 to the south,
  the room is about 60ft wide
- the 4 door seams have been melted,
  we are going to the east,
  Corey teaches Wayne/Garth to use the torch,
  they cut a hole in the door which takes 1 use of the battery, it is 9/10 of the way full
- Eva picks up a fork from the table
- We see a wonderous room with a lot of artifacts
  a 5ft tall metallic smart-metal object comes at us, it has a female voice,
  Mr G is going to be ever so upset, her arm turns into a tube, then is aimed at us,
  some gas comes out of the end of the tube
- Ted tries talking to it as it attacks, asking for some supplies to help rid the place of vermin
- The robot says but you are mr G, why would you get things from mr G.
  Ted says he just took care of the robots, the robot starts cleaning up insect bodies and that room.
- We are in a clean kitchen with gadgets, we rummage around the kitchen, Ted asks the robot to make a meal
  for all of us, giving us a fancy meal, complains there is not enough fresh food but heats up some tins
- We eat! A little rest with a good meal, +1hp each
- the robot says her name is Posey.
- We ask her to take us on a tour of the house,
  she opens the door from the kitchenette to a round hallway with several other doors.
  we see the sealed doors, and some that are not sealed.
  Posey blinks or her eyes turn red when she opens up the doors.
  The panel next to them show the same light as they open.
  She points around and shows everyone's rooms, labs,
  we decided that this is the Jetsons.....
